    /// game empties once a frame, every script on the machine draws into it, and past about
    /// three hundred and fifty on this install the game silently drops whatever is handed over
    /// after that -- so the script that pays for a busy frame is whichever draws LAST, whatever
    /// it drew. That is how a phone comes up in a car with no background: the bars beside the
    /// minimap had spent the list before the phone was asked for.
    ///
    /// Each mod counted its own rectangles and warned past the ceiling, which named nobody:
    /// four logs each saying "I drew forty" while the frame drew four hundred. So the count is
    /// SHARED. SHVDN loads every script into one AppDomain and ticks them one at a time on one
    /// thread, and AppDomain data is visible to all of them -- the same channel the splash uses
    /// to stack its rows. The tally lives there, keyed by mod, and every mod's log can say what
    /// the whole frame cost and who spent it. (Mods that are not ours -- iFruitAddon2, NativeUI
    /// -- draw into the same list and are not counted, so the frame's real total is the tally
    /// plus whatever they added.)
    ///
    /// AND THE SHARING IS A RULE, NOT A REPORT. Decoration -- gradient bands, specks, stacked
    /// corners -- asks Room first, and Room is no once the machine's frame is over the soft
    /// line AND this mod is over its share of it, which is the line divided by however many
    /// mods drew last frame. Whoever is under their share keeps their sparkle; whoever is over
    /// it loses theirs, until what it costs fits again. The instruments never go: a bar with no
    /// sheen is a bar and half a bar is a bug.

    /// ONE ANSWER FOR THE WHOLE FRAME, decided from the frame before. A live comparison would
    /// trim whichever decoration happened to ask late, differently every frame, at sixty a
    /// second -- which is a flicker, and the thing this exists to stop. And it comes back only
