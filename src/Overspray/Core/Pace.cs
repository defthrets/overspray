    /// all of them from one tick. Anything in that tick that YIELDS -- Model.Request with a
    /// timeout, Script.Wait, anything that hands the frame back and resumes later -- ends the
    /// tick for that frame, and every frame the script is away is a frame with no phone, no
    /// toasts and no bar on it. From the pavement that is the HUD flickering, and nothing
    /// about the flicker says which of a hundred systems did it.
    ///
    /// This does. The tick calls At with a name before each system it runs, and each call
    /// closes the segment before it: how long it took on the clock, and -- the thing that
    /// matters -- whether the game drew any frames while it ran. A segment that ran inside
    /// one frame drew none. A segment that yielded drew one per frame it was away, and that
    /// count is exactly the number of frames the HUD was dark. The name goes in the log with
    /// the count, once, and then no more than once every few seconds per name with a tally,
    /// so the thing that flickers every frame does not also fill the log every frame.
    ///
    /// Clock stalls -- a segment that never yielded but sat on the CPU for longer than a
    /// frame -- are logged too, because those are the stutters, and a stutter is the other
    /// thing nobody can tell the cause of from outside.
